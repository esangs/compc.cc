I don't have a fixed place of work most of the time, I like to travel, sing, play and walk. I am often in and out of major forums, and like to exchange technology with like-minded people on the Internet. Compared with the real world, it is often easier to meet people who share the same aspirations as me online.</p><p>I'm from China, I can speak Chinese and I'm currently learning English.</p><p>Currently I have two public websites: <a href="https://blog.junsangs.com/" target="_blank">Blog</a>, <a href="https://pis.junsangs.com/" target="_blank">API</a>.</p></body></html>
